# scheduler
day planner, scheduler app. 

I created this app as an assignment for a University of Richmond coding bootcamp. I utilized and learned jQuery, Local Storage, JavaScript, HTML, CSS etc. 

This app is to be used by the user to schedule events throughout the day. 

This deployed app can be found at https://seibert-gm90.github.io/scheduler/.
